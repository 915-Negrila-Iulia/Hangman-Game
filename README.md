# Hangman
Implemented a console-based variation of the classical Hangman game. The computer selects a Sentence that the user can attempt to guess, letter by letter. Each time the user guesses a correct letter, the computer fills in the sentence at the correct positions. In case the letter does not appear, the computer fills in a new letter in the word “hangman”, starting from the empty string. The game ends when the user has guessed the sentence (user wins) or when the computer fills in the “hangman” word (user loses).
